## Startup Design Framework

Consider building on to the prefab components of Startup Framework [http://designmodo.com/startup/]

Startup Design Framework contains components and complex blocks which can easily be integrated into almost any design. All of these components are made in the same style, and can easily be integrated into projects, allowing us to create hundreds of solutions for your future projects.

In other words, this repository follows partially the structure of Startup Design Framework [https://github.com/designmodo/startup-demo]
